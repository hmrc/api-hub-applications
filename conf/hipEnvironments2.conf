    deployTo = "test",

}

Validation rules?
Rank - unique, contiguous, min is 1, max is array size
id - unique, URL safe
isProductionLike - only one, must match production
production - must be real Id's
deployTo - must be real Id's
validateIn - must be real Id's
promoteTo - must be real Id's, not cyclical
apimUrl - valid URL
apiKey - mandatory if useProxy is true

Can we hold all config in the backend?
